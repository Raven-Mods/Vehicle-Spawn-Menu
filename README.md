# Vehicle-Spawn-Menu
The point of the script is to have a vehicle menu thatâ€™s easy to access with each category breaking up the list of cars, it can also be set In discord ace permissions so certain roles can spawn certain cars for example donator vehicles can be set to donator roles so only those people can spawn and use the cars/trucks
